 # 🤖Multi-source-AI-Chatbot
 
## 📌 Problem Statement

Existing chatbots are often limited to a single data source and fail to provide comprehensive and accurate responses.An intelligent Multiple Source AI Chatbot that integrates data from various sources such as user queries, PDFs, YouTube videos, and AI image generation models. The system provides accurate, context-aware responses through a single conversational interface using modern AI technologies.

**🎯Goal:To design and develop a Multiple Source AI Chatbot that intelligently retrieves, integrates, and presents information from multiple data sources, providing accurate, context-aware, and user-friendly conversational responses.**

## 💡 Solution Approach

The proposed solution involves designing a Multiple Source AI Chatbot that integrates data from various sources such as documents, databases, and web APIs. User queries are first processed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand intent and extract key information. Based on the query, relevant data is retrieved from multiple sources simultaneously.

The retrieved information is then filtered, combined, and passed to an AI language model to generate a unified, context-aware response. The chatbot interface allows users to interact in natural language, while the backend ensures efficient data retrieval, response generation, and context management. This approach improves accuracy, scalability, and usability compared to single-source chatbots.
